                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Slawomir.<br>
                    I'm frontend developer.<br>
                    And piping engineer.<br>
                    Who?<span id="irmhide">...</span><br><span id="irmshow"><!--This part is hidden by default.-->
                        <br>Well, piping is just about pipes. Small and big ones. Diameter 15mm up to 1000mm and above.
                        Easy topic? Yes, it's only about straight pipes?<br><br>
                        Lets take power plant for example. How long are pipes inside one powerplant? 1 km? 10km? Could
                        be even more than 100 km.<br><br>
                        <!--steelworks it's not my strong side yet.-->
                        Steel pipes, stainless steel pipes, plastic pipes. Which wall thickness? With or without
                        insulation? Heat tracing? Personal protection? Should it be lined inside? Rubber, glass? What
                        flows inside? Water, steam, natural gas, air, compressed air, process air, slurry. What is the
                        fluid pressure and temperature value? What pressure rating flanges we need? Would pipe supports
                        carry the load? Do we need anchor points? Do pipes have enough flexibility? Is there enough
                        space between pipes and electric trays? Is steel structure strong enough? Seems overwhelming.
                        Yes, it is. Even after dozen years of experience in this field there is still a lot to learn.
                        Industry is still moving on, new technologies are continuously shaping this proffesion. All of
                        above and much more need to be done to complete a plant piping. This is a job for well organized
                        team. Tasks are divided between specialized engineers. I'm one of them.<br><br>
                        Beside brain my tools to achive goals is software such as Plant 3D and CADWorx Plant Design.
                        Both are based on databases. One out of many task is to get reports like quantity material
                        report, clash report, isometric drawing list. Another is design simple (doesn't mean easy) 3D
                        piping plant layout. Both greenfield and brownfield projects. First is built from scratches,
                        second one is rebuilding existing installations.<br><br>
                        Last but not least, I'm recording short screencasts about efficient use of AutoCAD to share
                        knowledge and best practices.<br><br>
                        There are many similarities between frontend developer job and piping engineer. Because of that I learned HTML, CSS and JS.<br><br>
